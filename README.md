# "Dynamical" density profiles for dark matter halos
This package lets you calculate the “dynamical” density profiles of dark matter halos from a simulation snapshot (as described in …).
Written in Python, the code currently requires the snapshot to be taken from a dark-matter-only simulations.

# Getting started
See the file ```example_calculation_dynamical_profiles.py``` for a detailed example of how to use the dynamical density profile code.
