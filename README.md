# 'Dynamical' density profiles for dark matter halos
This Python package calculates the 'dynamical' density profiles of dark matter halos from a simulation snapshot.
The snapshot can be taken either from a dark-matter-only simulation or from a DM+stars simulation. In the latter case, the dynamical profile can be obtained for both the stellar and the DM component separately. The stellar profile is calculated in the combined potential of DM+stars.
(The snapshot can also be from a simulation containing DM+stars+gas but the role of the gas is not taken into account.)

# Getting started
See the file ```example.py``` for a detailed example of how to use the dynamical density profile code.
